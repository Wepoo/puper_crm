# CRM
Customer relationship management (CRM) is a term that refers to practices, 
strategies and technologies that companies use to manage and analyze customer
interactions and data throughout the customer lifecycle, with the goal of
improving business relationships with customers, assisting in customer retention
and driving sales growth. CRM systems are designed to compile information on
customers across different channels -- or points of contact between the customer
and the company -- which could include the company's website, telephone, live
chat, direct mail, marketing materials and social media.
